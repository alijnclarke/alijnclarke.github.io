#### Hello

So i’ve been meaning to start writing a blog for a while, by if by *writing* you think I mean some great works of technical triumph then you’re quite mistaken.. this will be a dump of my sometimes crazy IT ramblings.

for now this site is being served via [http://pages.github.io]() but who knows what the future holds, i’m running the dns via cloudflare.

Primarily I’ll post articles that will document how i’ve setup certain bits of infrastructure but I expect i’ll cover a wide range of topics.. anything from *sysadmin* to *reverse engineering* and more pointy blackhat type stuff.

I’m also a massive Apple fan boy, so expect write-ups and me moaning about other substandard operating systems that i’m forced to come into contact with.

#### My History
I graduated from a [Russell Group][2]University in 2014 after studying Computer Science, I then joined a graduate scheme at the UK’s largest telco, working in their cyber security practise based in Ipswich of all places…*shudder*.

I spent a year there gaining a while load of experience of the inner workings of mobile devices before switching to a large consultancy to work directly with some customers, this allowed me to build my skill set in order to take on my new role as a senior technical lead.

####  Current Technical Interests 

Having spent my whole career working with computer software (in one manner or another), I’ve now began looking at the hardware side of things.. specifically enterprise grade servers and network design.

I’m currently in the process of building a [homelab][3] mostly involving Dell servers and Cisco networking equipment, along with VMware virtualisation on the bare metal (thanks to VMUG licensing).

The plan is to use this environment as a testbed for any new tech I want to use at work or in my own personal projects.

####  Other Technical Interests
- Reverse Engineering (iOS)
- Objective-C Development
- DevOps
- Pen Testing
- Network Design & Hardening
- Hardware engineering
- Anything mac related
